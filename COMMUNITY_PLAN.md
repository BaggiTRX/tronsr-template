## Community Support Plan

Baggi seeks to fairly distribute the rewards of the Nodes it operates.

In keeping with our core beliefs, a simple 80-10-10 model will be observed.

· 80% of all rewards will be distributed to the Baggi community registred in baggi.co in proportion to all votes cast.

· 10% of all rewards generated by Baggi shall be retained by Baggi. The use of these rewards will be determined by the community on the first of every month by a 1 vote per active member voting structure.

· 10% of all rewards must be retained by Baggi for use as operating expenses.

REWARD FOR VOTE SR BAGGI:

As a Tron Super Representative candidate, we are currently earning rewards as a percentage of our share of the overall vote. Once elected and producing blocks for the blockchain, we will be earning 32 TRX per block produced.

We are now rewarding our voters at the rate of 0.000050 TRX per vote. This means for every 20,000 votes cast for Segrith1 (BAGGI.CO), the voter will receive 1 TRX per election cycle. There is a new election cycle every 6 hours, so 20,000 votes will net 4 TRX per day.

6 hours advance notice will be given when this advertised rate changes.

Our reward will airdrop every 6 hours UTC.

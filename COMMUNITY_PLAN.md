Currently, we are paying our voters 131% of the rewards received by the TRON blockchain.

Now we are rewarding our voters at a rate of 0.000020 TRX per vote. This means that for every 20,000 votes cast for Segrith1 (BAGGI), the voter will receive 0.4 TRX per election cycle. There is a new cycle of elections every 6 hours, so 20,000 votes will generate 1.6 TRX per day.

The rewards in BAGGI token will be like this: for every 20,000 Votes we will pay 60 BAGGI for each cycle, then you will get in the 4 cycles you will get 240 BAGGI per day

6 hours advance notice will be given when this advertised rate changes.

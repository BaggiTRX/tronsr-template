<h2>Community Support Plan</h2>
<p>Baggi seeks to fairly distribute the rewards of the Nodes it operates.</p>

<p>In keeping with our core beliefs, a simple 80-10-10 model will be observed.</p>

<p>· 80% of all rewards will be distributed to the Sesame community in proportion to all votes cast.</p>

<p>· 10% of all rewards generated by Baggi shall be retained by Baggi. The use of these rewards will be determined by the community on the first of every month by a 1 vote per active member voting structure.</p>

<p>· 10% of all rewards must be retained by Baggi for use as operating expenses.</p>
